I need comprehensive research for creating a ${contentType}.

User's Original Idea:

Based on all of the above information, conduct targeted research specifically focused on creating an effective ${contentType}. 

The research should be highly relevant to the specific type of content ("${contentType}") and the user's stated goals and preferences from their answers.

Please structure your research in the following format:

### Research for ${contentType} on ${idea.substring(0, 50)}...

#### ${contentType.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + contentType.slice(1)} Overview and Context Analysis
- **(Include 2-3 points with statistics, expert insights, or industry standards specifically for ${contentType})**

#### Audience Insights for this ${contentType}
- **(Include 2-3 points about the likely audience preferences, behaviors, or expectations for this type of content)**

#### Dramatic or Engaging Elements for ${contentType}
- **(Include 2-3 points about storytelling techniques, formats, or structures that work well for this specific content type)**

#### Content Strategy Elements
- **(Include 2-3 points about effective strategies, trends, or best practices for this type of content)**

For each section, prioritize specific facts, statistics, expert quotes, case studies, and examples that directly support the user's vision as expressed in their idea and answers.

Note: Don't just use placeholder text or generic information. Provide actual researched information that would be valuable for someone creating this specific ${contentType}.
